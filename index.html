                    Here is some unaligned text but I could not fit it into the other paragraph as it wasn't working for some reason.  Anyway, onto my table!
                </p>
                <div class="table">
                <table>

                        <th>Column 2</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>My table is very good</td>
                        <td>I think you would have to agree</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Can you tell this was part of the checklist?</td>
                        <td>The rows next to each other look kind of awkward</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                </div>
